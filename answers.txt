1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

	The gitignore file is used to exclude certain files from being uploaded to the repository. For a java project, it should include compiled class files, log files, and package files. Anything but the source code and necessary resources should be in the gitignore

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?

	Fast-forward is a way to describe the merging of branches that does not result in conflicts and can be merged automatically. This happens when a branch does not diverge from another branch

3. Why should you have different branches?

	Different branches are especially helpful for working on different parts of a project, especially with many people. People can have their own branches, or work on a specific feature branch without worrying about affecting the functionality of any of the other branches. This also allows for a running/working copy to always be available (master) while new features are worked on in other branches

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

	Usually one. However, there can be more if there are different programs involved in the same project, or under atypical circumstances
